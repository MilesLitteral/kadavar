INTRODUCTION
------------
An Addon I created for Blender that implements merge behavior similar to the now defunct SoftImage XSI 3d modelling and animation 
software package. Simply download the source or any release and drop the kadavar folder in your Blender 'Addon' folder. Perfect tool for speed modelling and/or rapid prototyping.

PARAMETERS
--------------
Select atleast two vertexes (can select up to atleast 64 vertexes in sequence currently)
Alt + K to access the behavior menu 
Select "Merge at Point" option to see the magic

Enjoy my creation which for years has helped me save hours on 3d modelling and focused more on animating and texturing instead!
